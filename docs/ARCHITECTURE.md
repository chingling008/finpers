finpers: Architecture Overview
This document provides a high-level overview of the architecture for the finpers personal financial tracking application. It outlines the key components, technologies, and their interactions.

1. Frontend

Technology: React
Role: Responsible for the user interface, handling user interactions, and displaying financial data.
Components:
Reusable UI components for elements like transaction lists, charts, and forms.
Container components that manage state and logic for specific features (e.g., transaction list, add transaction form).
Data Fetching:
Communicates with the backend API using libraries like Axios or Fetch API to retrieve and update financial data.
2. State Management

Technology: Redux
Role: Manages the application's global state, providing a single source of truth for financial data.
Components:
Redux store: Holds the application state.
Actions: Plain JavaScript objects that describe state changes.
Reducers: Pure functions that update the state based on dispatched actions.
3. Backend

Technology: Firebase Firestore
Role: Stores and manages financial data in the cloud.
Features:
Provides a NoSQL database for flexible data storage.
Offers real-time updates for efficient data synchronization (optional).
Enforces security rules to control data access (optional).
4. Authentication 

Technology: Firebase Authentication (or similar service)
Role: Provides user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
Features:
User registration and login.
Token-based authentication for secure API access.
5. Data Flow

User interacts with the UI (e.g., adds a transaction).
React components trigger actions that are dispatched to the Redux store.
Reducers update the application state based on the dispatched actions.
React components re-render based on the updated state.
If necessary, the frontend makes API requests to the backend using data from the store.
The backend API interacts with Firestore to store or retrieve financial data.
Firestore updates notify the backend, which can trigger updates back to the frontend (optional).
6. Deployment

The frontend application can be deployed as a static web app on platforms like Netlify or Firebase Hosting.
The backend API can be deployed as a serverless function using Firebase Functions or a similar service.
7. Benefits of this Architecture

Separation of Concerns: Clear separation between frontend, state management, and backend promotes maintainability and scalability.
Declarative UI: React allows for declarative UI components, simplifying development.
Predictable State Management: Redux provides a predictable way to manage application state.
Cloud-based Data Storage: Firestore offers a scalable and flexible solution for storing financial data.
Optional Authentication: Allows for secure access control if needed.
